        <h1>What is SELF://ARCHIVE?</h1>
        <p>
            Why do we grow so emotionally attached to certain objects — even the seemingly ordinary ones?
        </p>
        <p>
            I found myself thinking about this while going through my dad’s old coin collection. It was kept in a battered tin box, filled with coins from countries he’d never even been to. Some were gifts, others picked up during airport layovers, and a few he found at car boot sales — chosen more out of instinct than intention. But to him, they were priceless — small, metallic time capsules that connected him to places, people, and ideas he once held dear.

        <p>Each coin held a story. A fragment of memory. A moment of curiosity. And somehow, just holding them brought me closer to a version of him that I never really knew.</p>

<p>It made me realise how deeply we connect with the objects around us. They become vessels for memory, emotion, and identity — tangible reflections of moments that might otherwise slip away. Whether it’s a coin, a photo, or a handwritten note, these belongings quietly shape the way we remember and relate to the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they’re just things.
    But more often than not — they’re everything.</p>

    <p>A digital collection of these stories, SELF://ARCHIVE is a dynamic representation of the bonds we develop with the things we value most. Discover how commonplace objects can serve as mirrors of identity, memory, and connection by exploring and participating. Every entry in the archive contributes to an expanding constellation of the common human experience, a network of voices connected by the silent yet powerful bonds that bind us to our possessions.</p></p>
